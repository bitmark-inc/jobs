## Our need
Bitmark is seeking passionate people with the skills and vision to take our products to the next level. As a designer, you will help craft meaningful products that bring joy and autonomy to their users. 

## Our expectations 
- Understand Bitmark’s core technologies at the level required to drive design decisions.
- Work within existing design systems to craft clear and intuitive interfaces.
- Develop additional product assets, such as app store images, marketing collateral, and social media visuals.
- Collaborate directly with engineers to explore and realize designs.
- Validate implemented designs through user testing and community feedback.
- Construct UI prototypes to elicit feedback on future product directions.

## Our ideal candidate
- Skills & experience
  - Exceptional work experience in graphic design, preferably also with a university degree in the field. Interaction design or other product design experience is helpful but not necessary. 
  - Proven organization, time-management, and English communication skills. 
  - Demonstrated proficiency in contemporary software design tools, especially Figma.
- Mindset
  - You are a team player who cares more about making the best possible products than receiving individual credit. 
  - You seek honest and frequent feedback because you know it makes you stronger as a designer. You’re not afraid to give your best effort to something that might never be released. 
  - You appreciate both the challenge and freedom of working as part of a fast-paced, fully distributed global team.
