# Product Manager -- Autonomy

TEAM: Operations
LEVEL: Lead
TIME ZONE: Global

## Description
Much of the art world today is hidden in freeports or crypto wallets as financial assets. If this trend continues, art’s impact on culture, its ability to start conversations about human behavior and the state of the world will become completely irrelevant as the art world becomes the exclusive playground of the wealthy.

Autonomy is meant to help all types of people enjoy, experience, and grow their own digital art collection.

Success in this role means that you are making art relevant to everyday life. Think of how the people around you are affected by movies, music, and sports in their everyday lives - art has lost its importance in today’s culture. Your secret power is the ability to empathize across a diverse set of people, recreating that connection between art and everyday people through Autonomy.
