# Community Advocate

## Essential job functions

- The Community Advocate is a Bitmark team member whose mission is to fight for the individual, to connect with and advocate for the everyday person who needs/wants Bitmarkâ€™s tools and tech. This role will build relationships with end users of Bitmark tools and apps (both individual users as well as developers building applications) to gain their support and maintain it, simultaneously bridging their feedback and perspective back to the Bitmark team. The ideal candidate is energetic, multi-lingual, self-motivated, willing to fight through public rejection, and able to help anyone from any culture understand the relevance of property rights (and Bitmark tools) in their everyday lives.
- Above all, communication (empathic listening!) and humility are your most important tools. You work across multiple teams, including product, engineering, and marketing in order to help these teams understand external feedback and needs. You will need to shift your messaging for each stakeholder to persuade them without direct authority.
- Whether users and developers continue to consider Bitmark depends on the relationships you build with them, at scale.
- Winning opportunities to represent Bitmark publicly all over the world
- Developing outlets (ex. a forum or chat community) and tools for individuals to provide feedback (and receive prompt follow up) about Bitmark products, connecting these individuals to each other to amplify community network effect
- Serving as the relationship conduit between individuals and Bitmark staff; helping staff speak (and listen) to community members directly
- Proposing and executing communication materials (social media posts, pamphlets, website text) and events with other Bitmark teams to propel this overall mission forward
- Never losing sight of the individual's viewpoint; not allowing Bitmark to hide behind technical jargon or superiority.
